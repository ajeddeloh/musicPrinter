This is a program to print formatted music metadata. It uses libavformat to
extract the metadata, and thus will work on a large variety of files. 

Still in development, most features and flags not implemented yet.

Usage:
$ muprint [OPTIONS] format_string filename

The format string is similar to printf's format string. It uses % to denote
metadata chunks from the loaded file. %% is used to denote a literal %. each
metadata chunk is composed of an optional modifier character followed by a type
character. The modifier characters change the allowed characters, causing the 
illegal characters to be ignored or replaced with the character specified by
the -r option. If you need more advanced replace options, use another program
like tr.

MODIFIERS:
v - allow all printing (visible) ascii characters (as defined by isprint(3))
p - allow all characters in the POSIX.1-2008 portable filesystem character set
    (that is: all alphanumeric characters plus period (.), underscore(_) and
    hyphen (-). Does NOT enforce that the first character should not be hyphen
u - allow all characters that are valid characters in unix filenames (i.e. not
    '\0' and '/')
c - allows a custom set of characters, specified by the -c flag

TYPES:
t - The track title
T - The track number, does not currently support padding
d - The disc number, does not currently support padding
b - The album
A - The album artist
a - The artist
e - The file's original extension NOT IMPLEMENTED
f - The original file basename as defined in basename(3) NOT IMPLEMENTED
% - a literal % NOT IMPLEMENTED

examples:
/media/Music/%pA/%pb/%d-%T-%t.%e would be 
/media/<album artist>/<album>/<artist>/<disc>-<track>-<title>.<extension>
with all characters not in the metadata that are not in the posix portable
filesystem character set to be ignored/replaced

OPTIONS
-c <characters> specifies what the custom character whitelist should be. Just
    a string of characters e.g. "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
-s <original type><subsitition string> specifies what to replace a metadata
    element with if not found. Defaults to "unknown". Other metadata elements
    are valid. For example, you can replace all album artists with the artist
    using -s "A%a"
-r <single char> replace non-whitelisted characters with this one instead of
    deleting them

BUILDING:
You need libavformat and libavutil. Other than that its straight up C11 with
POSIX.1-200809L extensions, so just running
$ make
should work. If you're debuging there's also 
$ make debug
which turns on -g for you
