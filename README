This is a program to print formatted music metadata. It uses libavformat to
extract the metadata, and thus will work on a large variety of files. 

Still in development, most features and flags not implemented yet.

Usage:
$ muprint [OPTIONS] format_string filename

format_string accepts the following metadata, support for more is planned. each
are optionally prefixed with c or p for adding whitelisted characters. If you
want more fine grained control on character substitution look into tr. c means
"clean" as whitelists most non control characters, p means "posix" and
whitelists all characters in the POSIX.1-2008 portable filesystem character set
MODIFIERS
a - allow all printing ascii characters
p - allow all characters in the POSIX.1-2008 portable filesystem character set
    (that is: all alphanumeric characters plus period (.), underscore(_) and
    hyphen (-). Does NOT enforce that the first character should not be hyphen
c - allows a custom set of characters, specified by the -c flag

t - The track title
T - The track number, does not currently support padding
d - The disc number, does not currently support padding
b - The album
A - The album artist
a - The artist
e - The file's original extension

example:
/media/Music/%pA/%pb/%d-%T-%t.%e would be 
/media/<album artist>/<album>/<artist>/<disc>-<track>-<title>.<extension>

OPTIONS
-c <characters> specifies what the custom character whitelist should be. Just
    a string of characters e.g. "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
-s <original type><subsitition string> specifies what to replace a metadata
    element with if not found. Defaults to "unknown". Other metadata elements
    are valid. For example, you can replace all album artists with the artist
    using -s "A%a"
-r <single char> replace non-whitelisted characters with this one instead of
    deleting them
